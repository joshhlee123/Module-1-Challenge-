Cash App

Cash App is a mobile payments service or also known as a “P2P” (Peer to Peer) payments service. It was launched in 2013 by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey and his company, Square, Inc. It was originally launched as “Square Cash”. 

Cash App largely resides in the finance domain of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Service. This is defined by Investopedia as “a decentralized platform whereby two individuals interact directly with each other, without intermediation by a third party.” Examples of P2P services can range from Open-source Software, Filesharing, Online Marketplaces, Cryptocurrency and Blockchain, Homesharing, and Ridesharing. The reason this domain(specifically payment apps) has been growing so rapidly in the past two decades is because of its ability to let anyone receive and send money from their mobile devices (Forbes). 

Cash App launched to compete against other top P2P services such as Venmo, Paypal, Apple Pay, and Google Pay. In 2018, Cash App actually passed Venmo in number of downloads, with 33.5 million cumulative downloads. “As of March 2023, Cash App had 53 million monthly transacting activities. Venmo has about 83 million active users.” (Investopedia). It’s clear that CashApp has had a serious rate of growth which is only continuing to grow. 

“Cash App makes money by charging businesses and individuals transaction fees, from subscription services, and selling Bitcoin to customers.” (Investopedia). Cash App began adding new features, such as the ability to buy and sell Bitcoin in 2017, marking its entry into the cryptocurrency market. And this is currently the company’s largest revenue generator.

For the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2023, Cash App generated “revenues of $3.3 billion; an increase of 32.9% year-over-year”(Investopedia), with a gross profit of $931 million. 
Bitcoin alone accounted for $2.2 billion or 66.1% of this revenue total. 

Since “Block is putting a lot of focus on growing the Cash App ecosystem through products like Cash App saving and the Cash App debit card” (Insider Intelligence), I would base my recommendations off of this focus. With an expected growth of over 10 million users from 2023 to 2026, Cash App should focus on all parts of their ecosystem to ensure this growth as well as increase the usage of current users. 

In order to increase their customer bases’ usage of the Cash App debit card, Cash App should implement certain incentives. One thing they could implement, is to increase their current withdrawal limits, which vary per day, week, and month. This has its obvious risks, but could also garner more interest and usage in this part of their ecosystem. Additionally, they should build upon their Card Boost Program which provides discounts at various merchants and vendors when purchasing with the Cash Card, whether that be partnering with more businesses or offering more discounts. 

Cash App Saving is another part of the Cash App ecosystem that is receiving more focus from the service. One thing that they could implement into their saving service, is to incentivize customers to save more in Cash App by giving certain rewards for certain savings goals that are met. 

It's important for Cash App to continue to expand upon their P2P services as well as focus on their current ones, as P2P services are continuning to grow in the mobile space. Evidently, Cash App has been able to overtake top competitors in this domain such as Venmo which is no small feat. With the ease and accessibility of mobile payment and transaction services, this domain is projected to grow at an increased rate.
